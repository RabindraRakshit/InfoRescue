Improving information retrieval methods for OCR data sets consisting of Indic scripts

Project Abstract
----------------

This project aims at improving IR methods for OCRed data i.e. erroneous data. The mis-classification error introduced by OCR can significantly degrade the IR efficiency. We have to develop some IR methods which take these errors into account and give better results accordingly.

This project is part of Google Summer of Code 2013.
